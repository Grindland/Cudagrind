1. Requirements

Cudagrind has been tested and runs with the following parameters:

* Valgrind 3.6.0 or higher
* CUDA SDK 4.0 or higher
* Compatible CUDA driver
* GCC 4.4.7 or higher

Different compilers should work if they support the C99 standard
and GCC's C-(de)constructor extension.



2. Installation

To compile the Cudagrind set the location of both Valgrind's and the CUDA
driver's INCLUDE and LIB directories in the Makefile. Then call 'make new' to 
build libcudagrind.so and put it in an accessible location.

If the system does not offer a POSIX thread library add '-DCUDAGRIND_NOPTHREAD' 
to the CFLAGS. This stops Cudagrind from being thread-safe for hybrid programs.



3. Execution

To check a program with Cudagrind preload Cudagrind's libcudagrind.so and 
the CUDA driver's 'libcuda.so' in this order 

   export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libcudagrind.so:/path/to/libcuda.so:$LD_PRELOAD

. Then execute the program with Valgrind/Memcheck

   valgrind <executable>
   
. If necessary add a suppression file to avoid display of spurious errors in 
the CUDA runtime. For more information about generating and using suppression 
files see the Valgrind manual.
